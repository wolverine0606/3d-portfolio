## Introduction

This portfolio project was created using a sample from YouTube as a foundation. I wanted to replace my minimal portfolio with something more dynamic while complementing my GitHub profile and terminal website. The goal was to integrate 3D graphics, interactive animations, and parallax effects using Three.js while keeping the design intuitive and user-friendly. This site serves as both a showcase of my work and a demonstration of my skills in frontend development. And yes, I know the parallax gets tricky when resizing the window—I’ll fix it… one day… maybe. Or maybe one of you can.
